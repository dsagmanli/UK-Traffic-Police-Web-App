     <p>
Databases are everywhere. We interact with many different databases every day, whether using the web, electronic calendars, diaries or timetables, searching for contact details, or looking for directions on a mobile phone. As such databases need to be both easy to use and fast. We focus on both the structure of databases, including how to make them fast, efficient and reliable, and ways of interacting with them via user interfaces. 
    </p>
    <p>
We examine the fundamentals of the relational database model, its mathematical basis, as well as implementations of the model in database management systems (DBMS) and languages to interact with them such as Structured Query Language (SQL). We explore relevant software design principles such as understanding user requirements and specifications and how this relates to database design. Databases do not exist in isolation, and so we will also examine how to design and build ways to interact with them, specifically via web development for which database access is key.
